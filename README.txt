Please DO NOT take this program seriously, it does not provide any IT support.

The only function of this program is to provide laughs for IT techs and to provide a placebo affect to end users.

The only working buttons on this program are the restart button and the screenshot button. Every other input does
nothing to the underlying machine.

This program is used "as is", please use at your own risk.
