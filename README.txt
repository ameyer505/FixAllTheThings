Please DO NOT take this program seriously, it does not provide any IT support.

The only function of this program is to provide laughs for IT techs and to provide a placebo affect to end users.

The only working buttons on this program are the 

1) Restart button -> Restart the computer in 10 seconds-ish
2) Screenshot button -> Takes a screenshot of the primary display desktop and saves it to the users Desktop folder in a file called screenshot.bmp
3) Network test button -> Pings www.google.com and sees if there is a response

Every other input does nothing to the underlying machine.

This program is used "as is", please use at your own risk.
